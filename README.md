This repo offers a comprehensive guide on utilizing the SMART HCC score developed by Huapeng Lin, Guanlin Li, and our colleagues and collaborators. 
This GitHub Page https://tcfyip.github.io/SMART-HCC-score/ provides step-by-step instructions on how to calculate the SMART HCC score for both individual patients and a group of patients. <br />
